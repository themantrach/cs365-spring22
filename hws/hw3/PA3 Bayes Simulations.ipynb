However, it falsely identifies 40% of ham emails as spam. There are three testing data sets to assess our algorithm on. The first test set has 25% of the emails as spam, the second test set has 50% of the emails as spam, and the third data set has 75% of the emails as spam. For each data set, compute the following probabilities both analytically and by simulation. Assume that the number of emails for each of the three tests sets is 10,000.\n",
